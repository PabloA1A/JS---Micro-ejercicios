# JS - Micro ejercicios

## Requirements:
Before writing code, using comments leave a reflection of the algorithm you have followed.
Example:
/*
* Connect javascript file to the target html file
* Print Hello Javascript! in our browser window
* define the container or space to be occupied by the Hello JS message
* access the container from javascript
* create the message
* * insert in the container
* * print it on screen
*/

## For each exercise you will need to create an html file and a js file. If you want to add styles, you know, you will also need to create a css file.
Remember to create a repository for these exercises. Here is a possible structure for your repository.

> src
ex-1
index.html
app.js
styles.css
ex-2
index.html
app.js
styles.css

If you prefer to work with only one html file, here is a possible structure for your repository. IMPORTANT: each exercise is an independent javascript file. The use of Windows.prompt() is forbidden. If data is requested to a user it must be done through form input and an event.

> src
index.html
js
ex-1.js
ex-2.js

1. Write a program that writes on the screen a text of type <h1> that says “Hello JavaScript”.

2. Write a program that writes to the screen “The sum of 3 + 5 is <result>”.

3. Write a program that prompts for the user's name with an input and writes text that says “Hello <username>”.

4. Write a program that asks for two numbers and writes “The sum of <number-one> with <number-two> is <result>”.

5. Write a program that asks for two numbers and writes on the screen which is the larger one.

6. Write a program that asks for 3 numbers and writes to the screen the largest of the three.

7. Write a program that asks for a sentence and writes how many times the letter a appears.

8. Write a program that asks for a sentence and writes the vowels that appear.

9. Write a program that asks for a sentence and types how many vowels are in the sentence.

10. Write a program that asks for a sentence and types how many times each vowel appears.

11. Write a program that asks for a number and tells us if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 7 (just check if it is divisible by one of the four).

12. Add to the previous exercise to tell us by which of the four is divisible (we must say all by which it is divisible).

13. Write a program that writes on the screen the divisors of a given number.

14. Write a program that writes on the screen the common divisors of two given numbers.

15. Write a program that tells us if a given number is prime (it is not divisible by any number other than itself or unity).
